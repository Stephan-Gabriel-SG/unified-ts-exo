# Patientor frontend

### Getting started

- To get the app running just install its dependencies with `npm install` and run it with `npm run dev`.
- The app should work without a backend, but make sure that the request made to `/api/ping` made on startup is successful before continuing.
- get the backend here [patientor backend](https://github.com/Stephan-Gabriel-SG/ts-patientor-backend)
